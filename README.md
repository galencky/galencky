👋 Hi, I’m @galencky

👀 I’m interested in medicine, particularly radiation oncology and medical informatics, photography and videography, Python programming, AI applications in healthcare, IoT projects, and automation for improving medical workflows.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Python, FastAPI, LINE chatbot development integrated with Google Gemini API, medical data parsing, Arduino-based IoT solutions, financial investment strategies, and advanced photographic techniques.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on healthcare-related AI projects, medical informatics, chatbot development for multilingual patient education, IoT applications in healthcare, and collaborative photography and videography projects.

📫 How to reach me: galen147258369@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I love pixel-peeping and analyzing lens sharpness in photography almost as much as debugging complex Python scripts.
